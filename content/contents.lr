content:

This a heavily modified and expanded version of the [FreeHTML5](https://freehtml5.co/) ["Icon" template](https://freehtml5.co/icon-free-website-template-using-bootstrap/) ported to the [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) static CMS by [Daniel Althviz](https://dalthviz.github.io/) and the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) development team; it was initially derived from the [Hugo port](https://github.com/SteveLane/hugo-icon) of the Icon theme by [Steve Lane](https://gtown-ds.netlify.com/).
The core template is a single-page, responsive layout, with sections for describing your organization and its mission, services, a gallery, your team and how visitors can download your software or donate to your cause.

It also features additions including a built-in blog, generic page template, custom error page, common navbar, Gitter, Disqus, RSS/Atom and OpenCollective integration, heavy customizability, numerous fixes and improvements, and re-written for speed, extensibility, responsiveness and conformance.
The theme is designed to be more desktop and mobile-friendly, and designed and tested to smoothly adapt to a wide variety of viewport sizes from well below 480px all the way to 4K, and closely follows modern web standards while still offering compatibility with a wide range of modern and legacy browsers.

title: Content Page

subtitle:

A minimalist model sharing the navbar, footer and basic style with the rest of the theme, allowing for extensive customization.
-----
description:

Sometimes a stock page design, no matter how flexible or varied, just isn't enough—maybe you want to include traditional article-style pages on your domain, design a template to meet specific requirements, or just a blank canvas to fill with your ideas that still fits in with the rest of the site. For all of those cases and more, Lektor-Icon offers an standard page model, which includes all the standard ``<head>``, navigation and footer elements from the rest of the theme along with simple, clean and consistent styling, allowing you to easily include long-form content, make your own templates while retaining all the advantages of the themes, or style it to your heart's content.
